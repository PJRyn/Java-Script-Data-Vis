# Unit 14 Homework: Belly Button Biodiversity

In this assignment I had used javascript and html to create a dashboard that provided a summary of the data set form [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/). However the data was grabbed from [json link](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json"). This task allows the user to select an ID from a drop down menu. When the user does this it updates the dashboard presenting a horizontal bar chart, a bubble bar chart, a meta-data readout about the test subject and a gauge of how many times a week they wash their belly button. Contained within is the index.html that runs the website. Within the static/js is the app.js that runs the data visualizations and a copy of the [json link](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json") as a json. The code runs on the static website provided by github, alternatively cloning the repo and running the index.html will create a local website.
